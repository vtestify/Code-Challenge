# vTestify Coding Challenge

Create a Tic-tac-toe game where a user plays versus an unbeatable computer player. All games must end in either a loss or draw between the end-user & computer player.

You will mostly be judged on code-style, quality & ability to walk us through your implementation. You will not be judged negatively if you implement an algorithm you find online ðŸ˜‡

## Acceptance Criteria
1. You may only use Javascript & Ruby
1. You may build any user-interface you desire to communicate the game's state
1. You may use any JS modules or Ruby gems you wish
1. You may **not** use any kind of module or gem that implements the computer's AI for you
1. Please keep your implementation private. Do not publish this as open-source.

## Please Note
Tic-tac-toe is a solved game & has been used by many organizations in the past as a coding exercise. We are mostly interested in evaluating your code style, selection of algorithm & ability to explain your implementation in plain English to others. We do not score submissions higher or lower depending on if they implement a minmax AI, rules-based solution, or hard-code every possible board state.
